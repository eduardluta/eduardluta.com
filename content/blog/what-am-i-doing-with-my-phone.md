title: What Am I Doing with My Phone?

I noticed that I unlock my phone dozens of times without remembering why. So I built a short survey using Shortcuts. Every time I unlock my phone, it prompts me to choose what I'm about to do.

The data quickly revealed the mindless loops: Twitter, email, and refreshing analytics. Being aware of it is the first step, but the real win is that it slows me down enough to ask if the action is deliberate.

My plan is to evolve the shortcut into something that recommends better defaults. If I open Twitter more than five times per hour, remind me to stretch or call a friend instead. Small interruptions to break the pattern.
