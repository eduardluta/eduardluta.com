title: Tracking My Water Intake
date: 2021-07-24

I am trying to drink more water. The obvious first step is to measure it, so I started logging every glass inside a tiny shortcut I built with a few taps on my watch.

The shortcut appends a timestamped entry into a text file in iCloud Drive. Once a week I copy the data into a Numbers spreadsheet and review the averages. It takes less than five minutes and reveals how inconsistent I am whenever my routine changes.

The most helpful insight so far: pairing the habit with existing rituals makes it stick. Filling a glass before I sit down to write in the morning adds three cups per day without much effort.
