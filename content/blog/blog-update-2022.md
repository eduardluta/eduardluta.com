This weekend I tore down the old version of this site and rebuilt it from scratch. The goal was simple: make it fast, make it easy to publish, and make it feel like home.

The biggest change is the navigation. The sidebar now lists every project I am tinkering with, plus a secondary menu of experiments. Having everything visible at a glance helps me share things that would otherwise remain hidden on my hard drive.

I also rewrote the content layer. Posts live in plain Markdown files. A tiny build script converts them into HTML, adds metadata, and ships the static assets. No databases, no frameworks. Just files.

There is still a lot to do — comments, better code formatting, and a way to surface related projects. But it finally feels like a place I can continue to evolve instead of something I need to replace.
