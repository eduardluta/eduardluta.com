title: Pagi on the App Store

Two years ago today, I wrote my first morning pages. A practice I wouldn't want to live without anymore. To celebrate the anniversary, I shipped something I used for myself to the App Store today.

I submitted it for review on Thursday. Five days ago, to see the review team enough time to review all the things we had in flight. They killed it on Sunday night. Today it's live.

On Friday morning I found my submission rejected with the following message citing Guideline 4.3. Design: Spam:

> We noticed that your app provides the same feature set as other apps submitted to the App Store. Specifically, that you submitted your new app under a different developer account. The new submission of this app may be a attempt to manipulate the App Store review process.

I can see how Pagi is similar to other apps in the App Store. It is focused. However, I built it for myself to explore how the iOS stack helps me design the morning pages flow.

Instead of arguing that the template is similar to another app previously submitted, I explained that an Apple Developer Program account can support numerous apps.

The best thing about a rejection is that you immediately know what the next action should be. You can react, learn something about the process, and move forward.
