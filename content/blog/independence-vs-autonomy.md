Independence is the ability to make decisions without interference. Autonomy adds something more: the resources, trust, and systems to act on those decisions responsibly. I have been thinking about that distinction a lot while designing how our team works.

Over the past year we shifted from approving every task to agreeing on desired outcomes. It felt risky at first, but it unlocked an enormous amount of energy. People stopped waiting for permission and started shipping ideas none of us would have conceived alone.

True autonomy needs clarity. We write down operating principles, budgets, and what success looks like. Constraints are not cages—they are the guardrails that keep the lanes clear so that everyone can move quickly.

My job now is to protect that environment. Say no to distractions, keep communication transparent, and make sure the feedback loops stay short. When those pieces are in place, autonomy becomes sustainable instead of chaotic.
