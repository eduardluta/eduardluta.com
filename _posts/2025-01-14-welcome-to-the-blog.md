This is the first post created with Decap CMS.

## What This Blog Is About

I'll be writing about:

- Building products at the intersection of AI and meaning
- Marketing insights from 10+ years in the field
- Consciousness, code, and the patterns that connect them
- Lessons from building dua.com and MIK Group

## Why a CMS?

I wanted a simple way to publish thoughts without fighting with HTML every time. Decap CMS provides a clean interface while keeping everything in git.

No database. No complicated build process. Just markdown files and version control.

## What's Next

More regular writing. Less friction between thought and publication.

Let's see where this goes.
